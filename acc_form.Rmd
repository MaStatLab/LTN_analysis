<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!--

1. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows: 

- [ ] This is a checkbox 

To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that current versions of RStudio for Mac (this will change with RStudio versions 1.3 and higher) will not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.

2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 

3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.

This form documents the artifacts associated with the article (i.e., the data and code supporting the computational findings) and describes how to reproduce the findings.


# Part 1: Data

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

<!--
If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the Code section. Otherwise, continue.
-->

- [x] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

<!-- If data are simulated using random number generation, please be sure to set the random number seed in the code you provide -->

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->

This paper uses the 16S rRNA sequencing data from the T1D cohort of the DIABIMMUNE study (Kostic et al., 2015). The sample-level data, including the OTU table, taxonomy table and the covariate information, is available at https://diabimmune.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune/t1d-cohort/resources/16s-sequence-data. The (subject-level) cohort information is available at  https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.chom.2015.01.001/attachment/1f0883f8-1df7-447d-a47b-c1aa2bb2bbaf/mmc2.xlsx. 

## Availability


- [x] Data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Data **cannot be made** publicly available.

If the data are publicly available, see the *Publicly available data* section. Otherwise, see the *Non-publicly available data* section, below.

### Publicly available data

- [x] Data are available online at: https://diabimmune.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune/t1d-cohort/resources/16s-sequence-data and https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.chom.2015.01.001/attachment/1f0883f8-1df7-447d-a47b-c1aa2bb2bbaf/mmc2.xlsx 

- [ ] Data are available as part of the paperâ€™s supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:

-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

-->

## Scope

The provided workflow reproduces:

- [ ] Any numbers provided in text in the paper

- [ ] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below:


## Workflow

### Format(s)

- [ ] Wrapper (shell) script(s)
- [ ] Self-contained R Markdown file, Jupyter notebook, or other literate programming approach
- [x] Text file (e.g., a readme-style file) that documents workflow
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Other (more detail in *Instructions* below)

### Instructions

<!--
Describe how to use the materials provided to reproduce analyses in the manuscript. Additional details can be provided in file(s) accompanying the reproducibility materials.
-->

### Expected run-time

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard desktop machine:

- [ ] < 1 minute

- [ ] 1-10 minutes

- [ ] 10-60 minutes

- [ ] 1-8 hours

- [ ] > 8 hours

- [x] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described here: 

  The simulation study and case study is run on the computing cluster. For each simulation setting, an example of running a single simulation is provided in the readme file. It typically takes less than 6 hours for a certain simulation round. (We tested the run-time on a machine with 8 GB memory and 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.)
